notes: further optimisations: (1) ensure no stranded cells that are not reachable by an adjacent node so that there are no cases of singular 
connectivity to the same group. for example, in the current solution, look up at the seventh row from the bottom and there are two groups
where one has a single connection and the other has two single connections; (2) optimise or produce details for welding strip lengths.
